The DFM is used to measure fuel flowing in the fuel line of equipment by generating signal equivalent to the amount of fuel passing through it. There are various types of flowmeters with different specifications and properties depending on userâ€™s choice. Appropriate flowmeter for a specific application can be selected based on factors such as flowrate, engine type, interface type etc.

Digital output interfaces of DFM A232/C232/D232 and DFM A485/C485/D485 are physically implemented on the base of RS-232 and RS-485 interfaces. Data transfer from DFM to RS-232 and RS-485 interfaces is carried out in request/response mode according to Modbus protocol. Up to four flow meters can be simultaneously connected to the tracking device under Modbus protocol. Unique decimal addresses from 0 to 255 are used for their identification in network (default address is 111).
